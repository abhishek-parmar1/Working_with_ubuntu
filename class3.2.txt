NOTES :
1> cat fileName : just tto display file content
2> more fileName : display file in formated way
3> less fileName : display file in formated way
4> head fileName : display by default top 10 lines
   head -15 fileName : for 15 top lines 
5> tail fileName : display bottom 10 lines
   tail -15 fileName : for bottom 15 lines
6> tail -f fileName : display the bottom content of the file which is dynamically changing

NANO EDITOR : 
7> nano fileName : start the nano editor
very easy to use, commands at the bottom of the editor. 

VI EDITOR :
8> vi fileName : open a file
9> view fileName : open in read only format.
a lot of commands. you can use a gui editor rather than using it. 

* use nano and vi in case of server connections ssh. But in case of local use any of the editor.

FIND FILES AND DIRECTORIES :
10> find [path] [expression]
	Patterns :
 		  By -name 
			find /sbin -name mkdev
		  BY -iname (ignore case)
			find /sbin -iname mkdev
			find /sbin -name *v (any file that ends with v)
  		  BY -mtime days (days old files)
			find /sbin -mtime +10 -mtime -13 (files that are 10 days old but not more than 13 days old)
			find /sbin -type d -newer fileName ( all the directories that are newer than the file)
		  By -size num ( files of size num)
			find /sbin -size +1M (file greater than 1MB size)
		  By -newer file (files that are newer tahn file)
		  -exec command {} \; ( run command against all the files that are found, these guesses that the files are about what)
